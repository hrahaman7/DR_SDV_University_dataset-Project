# University Data Analysis with SVD
Welcome to the University Data Analysis with SVD project! This repository demonstrates the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization on a university dataset. The project shows how to decompose a dataset into singular values and vectors, reduce dimensions, and visualize the results.

# Features
SVD Algorithm: Implementation of Singular Value Decomposition for matrix factorization and dimensionality reduction.

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for SVD.

Data Visualization: Visualizations of data in reduced dimensions using scatter plots and other charts.

Configurable Parameters: Choose the number of singular values and vectors to retain, as well as other parameters through command line arguments.

Documentation: Clear code comments and guides to help you understand the project.
# Introduction
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a mathematical technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, providing insight into the underlying structure of the data. This project applies SVD to a university dataset to identify patterns, reduce dimensions, and visualize the data.


# Dataset
The provided university dataset (universities.csv) includes features such as location, student enrollment, graduation rates, and other factors. The project uses this dataset as an example for SVD analysis. You can use your own dataset by specifying the path to your CSV file in the usage instructions.

# Results
The SVD script provides:

Reconstructed Matrix: The matrix reconstructed using the retained singular values and vectors.

Visualizations: Scatter plots or other charts showing the data projected into the reduced-dimensional space.
